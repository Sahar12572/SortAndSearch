# 🔍 SortAndSearch Java Program

Welcome to the **SortAndSearch** project — a simple but solid Java console application that demonstrates basic searching and sorting algorithms. This is perfect for beginner Java developers or students brushing up on algorithmic logic. 

## 🚀 What It Does

This Java program does the following:

1. Performs a **Linear Search** for the number `9` in an unsorted array.
2. Sorts the array using the **Insertion Sort** algorithm.
3. Performs a **Binary Search** for the number `9` in the now sorted array.
4. Outputs clear, step-by-step results in the console.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Linear Search (for unsorted arrays)
- ✅ Insertion Sort (sorts array in ascending order)
- ✅ Binary Search (for sorted arrays)
- ✅ Output includes clear console messages for better readability

## 🧠 Algorithms Explained

- **Linear Search**: Checks each element one by one until it finds the target or reaches the end.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by comparing and inserting elements in their correct positions.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently searches in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## 💻 Sample Output
```bash
Linear Search for 9:
Found 9 at index: 10

Sorting the array using Insertion Sort...
Sorted array: [-40, -3, -1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 16, 18, 27, 35, 100]

Binary Search for 9:
Found 9 at index: 8
```
## 📁 How to Run

Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

1. **Clone this repository** or download the `.java` file.
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac SortAndSearch.java
Run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
java SortAndSearch

## 🌱 Why This Project?
This project was created as part of a learning journey to better understand:

How basic algorithms work

When and why to use different search methods

The importance of sorting data before using binary search
