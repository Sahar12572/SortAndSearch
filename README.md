# 🔍 Sort and Search Program (Java)

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates three classic algorithms:

- ✅ **Linear Search** (unsorted array)
- ✅ **Insertion Sort**
- ✅ **Binary Search** (sorted array)

## 📦 Features

- Allows user input to specify the number they want to search for.
- Searches for the number using linear search.
- Sorts the array using insertion sort.
- Then searches again using binary search on the sorted array.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Java (Standard Edition)
- CLI interaction using `Scanner`
## 📁 How to Run

Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

1. **Clone this repository** or download the `.java` file.
2. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac SortAndSearch.java
Run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
java SortAndSearch

## 🌱 Why This Project?
This project was created as part of a learning journey to better understand:

How basic algorithms work

When and why to use different search methods

The importance of sorting data before using binary search
